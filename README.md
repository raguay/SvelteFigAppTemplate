## Svelte Fig App Template

This template is used to create new applications for [fig](https://docs.withfig.com/). 
This template is a full Svelte Application with (mdsvex)[https://mdsvex.com/]. This 
gives you a great development environment for having documentation at the root level 
with Svelte components throughout it.

To get started, use this command to create your own local copy:

```
npx degit raguay/SvelteFigAppTemplate <your fig app name>
```

This will create your new application without all the history of the repository. Then 
compile and test it on your fig application like so:

```
npm run build
fig local index.html
```

If you find a problem or just have a question, please create an issue and I'll get back 
to you.
